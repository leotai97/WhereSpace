WhereSpace - as in where has all my disk space gone.

Run the program, type in a path or click the path button to browse for a path.

Click the scan button or press enter if the text cursor is still in the path text box.

Once the scan is complete you will be able to browse your directory structure by how much disk space is used in each directory.

The program is simple and does not attempt to elevate permission automatically, if you want to scan protected areas you will have to run the program as administrator. 

You can re-sort the directories with the "Low" / "High" button.
